# oh-my-zsh-custom

These are my custom set of plugins and themes(prompts) that I use with zsh.

## Setup

Symling the contents of the `./plugins` and `./themes` folder to the `.config/oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` and `.config/oh-my-zsh/custom/themes` folders respectively.

You can do this automatically by executing:
```sh
./setup
```

Or manually by doing following for each plugin and theme:
```sh
ln -rs $HOME/.config/oh-my-zsh-custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting $HOME/.config/oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
